/**
Follow up for N-Queens problem.

Now, instead outputting board configurations, return the total number of distinct solutions.

Analysis:

Same idea just a little bit difference from the previous one.

Note:
If I use the vector as the data structure, the code cannot pass the large online judge, however, if I use the dynamic array, which successfully pass all the online judge test. What the hell? lol
